## Sections and Tags 

### The HTML file is organized into sections using semantic HTML tags. Here are the main sections used in this project and their purposes:

### header: Represents the header section of the webpage. This is where you typically place your site's logo and navigation links.

### main: Contains the main content of the webpage, including the testimonials. It's the central area where your content is displayed.

### article: Each testimonial is wrapped in an <article> tag. This tag is used to define a self-contained piece of content, such as a testimonial, that makes sense on its own.

### section: The main testimonials section is divided into <section> tags. These help organize content into meaningful groups.

### img: Used to display images of the individuals giving testimonials. The alt attribute of each image provides alternative text for accessibility.

Semantic HTML tags enhance accessibility and provide structure to your web page, making it more readable and understandable by both humans and search engines.
